state-machine
==============
Generates java classes to handle state transitions based on a state machine defined with type safety in java. Supports 
immutability (though is opinionated in the sense that if you want to mutate your objects you can).

* Concise API using method chaining
* leverages the simplicity of the Exectuable UML approach
to state diagrams (one Event type for each State)
